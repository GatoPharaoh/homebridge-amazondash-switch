CMD Plugin for [HomeBridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) (API 2.0)

### How to use this plugin with Amazon Dash Buttons
In order to use this plugin with Amazon Dash Buttons you need to do the following things:
1. find the MAC adresse of your Amazon Dash Button(s)
   - via your router dashboard where the MAC adresse of your Dash Button should show up
   - via [node-dash-button](https://github.com/hortinstein/node-dash-button)
2. Assign your Dash a fixed IP adress (e.g. 192.168.0.230 - depends on your network)
3. leave on and off command empty - just state the line state_cmd (see Advanced Configuration and config-sample.json)
4. go to the HomeKit app of your choice and go to the automation tab
5. create a new automation and use "an Accessory is Controlled"
6. choose your Dash Button as Accessory and press active
7. choose your lamp, plug, etc. to be controlled.
8. DONE

### What this plugin does
Besides the functions intended by the main developer (see below) is plugin is ablet to Ping your Amazon Dash Button. This makes HomeKit know if a Dash Button has been pressed.

This plugin allows you to run Command Line Interface (CLI) commands via HomeKit. This means you can run a simple commands such as `ping`, `shutdown`, or `wakeonlan` just by telling Siri to do so. An example usage for this plugin would be to turn on your PS4 or HTPC, check if itâ€™s on, and even shut it down when finished.

### How this plugin works
1. `on_cmd`: This is the command issued when the switch is turned ON.
2. `off_cmd`: This is the command issued when the switch is turned OFF.
3. `state_cmd`: This is the command issued when HomeBridge checks the state of the switch.
  1. If there is no error, HomeBridge is notified that the switch is ON.
  2. If there is an error, HomeBridge is notified that the switch is OFF.

### Things to know about this plugin
This plugin can only run CLI commands the same as you typing them yourself. In order to test if your `on_cmd`, `off_cmd`, or `state_cmd` are valid commands you need to run them from your CLI. Please keep in mind you will want to run these commands from the same user that runs (or owns) the HomeBridge service if different than your root user.
